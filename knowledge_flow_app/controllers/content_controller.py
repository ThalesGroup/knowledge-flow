    Controller responsible for serving document content and previews.

    Current Responsibilities:
    --------------------------
    This controller exposes read-only endpoints to access document content:
    - Serve raw binary files uploaded during ingestion
    - Serve full Markdown previews rendered from extracted/processed content

    It bridges the backend storage layer with frontend-facing APIs that:
    - Render documents in the UI (markdown preview)
    - Allow download of original files (raw content)

    Design Note:
    ------------
    In the current implementation, this controller operates in a **passive role**:
    it only retrieves content, with no ingestion or transformation logic.

    In future iterations, the platform may introduce:
    - A separate **Content Upload API** (to decouple ingestion and upload)
    - Access control or document-level authorization
    - Support for streaming large files or paginated markdown rendering

    Developers should treat this controller as **stable**, with low coupling to
    the processing pipeline. It is safe to extend for new access-related use cases.

    Endpoints:
    ----------
    - `GET /markdown/{document_uid}`: returns the full markdown preview of a document
    - `GET /raw_content/{document_uid}`: streams the original uploaded file for download

    Dependencies:
    -------------
    - `ContentService`: abstracts retrieval from storage backend (e.g., filesystem, MinIO)
