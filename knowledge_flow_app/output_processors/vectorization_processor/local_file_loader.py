    Local File Loader
    -------------------
    LocalFileLoader is a concrete implementation of DocumentLoaderInterface.
    It loads documents from a local file system. It reads the file content and wraps it in a LangChain Document.
    
    This class is designed to be used in a vectorization pipeline where documents need to be loaded,
    processed, and stored in a vector store.

    It is a simple implementation that does not require any external dependencies.
