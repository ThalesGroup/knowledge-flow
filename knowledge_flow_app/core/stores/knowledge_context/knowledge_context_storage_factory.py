def get_knowledge_context_store() -> BaseKnowledgeContextStore:
    """
    Factory method that returns the appropriate KnowledgeContextStore implementation
    based on the current application configuration.

    A KnowledgeContextStore is responsible for persisting and retrieving user- or
    project-specific context information that should be accessible to an agent during
    a conversation.

    This typically includes:
    - Structured or semi-structured **textual data** (e.g. notes, project descriptions)
    - Uploaded **files** (e.g. documents, reports, contracts)
    - Any other input that contributes to the *knowledge state* associated with a user or profile.

    The goal is to allow the agent to retrieve and leverage this context dynamically
    during a chat session to offer more personalized and relevant answers.

    The backing implementation can vary:
    - 'local' for local filesystem-based persistence
    - other types (e.g., cloud, database, S3) may be added in the future

    Returns:
        An instance of a subclass of BaseKnowledgeContextStore.
