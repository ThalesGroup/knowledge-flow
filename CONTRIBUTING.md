## ‚úÖ Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure:

- [ ] Your code builds and runs locally using `make run`
- [ ] Code follows the existing style and structure
- [ ] You included relevant unit or integration tests for your changes
- [ ] The PR includes a clear **description** and motivation

A CI pipeline will automatically run all tests when you open or update a pull request. The internal maintainers will review only those MRs that pass all CI checks.

## üßæ License

All contributions must be compatible with the project‚Äôs open source license (see `LICENSE` file in the repo).

---

## üêõ Issues Management

- Use **plain English** when reporting issues or requesting features.
- Apply only the **default GitHub labels** (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`) ‚Äî do not create custom labels.
- Include:
  - Clear and concise problem description
  - Steps to reproduce (if a bug)
  - Motivation and expected behavior (if a feature)

---

## üéØ Pre-commit checks

To ensure the code you are about to push is quite clean and safe, we provide some pre-commit hooks:

- Check PEP8 compliance and fix errors if possible: `ruff check --fix`
- Format the code: `ruff format`
- Detect secrets: `detect-secrets`  # pragma: allowlist secret
- Analyzer the code: `bandit`

To install the pre commit hooks on your environment after it is ready (see the `dev` target of the Makefile), type this command:
```
pre-commit install
```

Then you can test manually the hooks with this command:
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Clean Commit History

If your branch has a messy or noisy commit history (e.g. "fix typo", "oops", "test again", etc.), we encourage you to squash your commits before merging.

Squashing helps keep the main branch history clean, readable, and easier to debug.

Tip: Use git rebase -i or select "Squash and merge" when merging the PR.
